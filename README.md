# Daily Planner

Here is a simple daily planner app made in angular.

## Technologies Used:
____
* Visual Studio Code
* Javascript, Angular
* Bootstrap

## Answer to Questions :
____

*  After searching for software developer jobs, we chose Angular because of the popularity and ‘hotness’ of the framework in the job market, along with React.

* Along with the MERN stack, the MEAN stack is arguably just as popular which includes mongo, express, ‘angular’, and node versus mongo, express, react, and node.

* Angular makes dynamic web apps. It aims to simplify the development of applications along with testing of those applications, as it provides a framework for client side MVCs(model-view-controller), and MVVMs(model-view-viewmodel).
* Angular provides features that were never present in any other JS framework in the past including MVC architecture as mentioned above as well as two way data binding, no more JQuery or getElementBy.

* The top alternatives to angular include many frameworks, but a few that we will list here are React(as mentioned above), Vue, Aurelia, Ember, Riot, Mithril, and Backbone.

* * AngularJS was created as side project in 2009, by two developers named Misko Hevery and Adam Abrons. Originally, it was named GetAngular, which would be an end to end tool that allowed web designers to interact with the front end of an application along with the backend.
* Angular is currently maintained by Google.

* Angular seems to be very fast (quick in development) and reliable. It seems similar to React as you can reuse components as well. The fact the technology is maintained by Google also gives it a trust factor.

* The biggest hurdles seem to just be that it is a different technology than what we have been practicing and what we are used to so far. As like every new technology, it just takes some time getting used to.

*  We would recommend angular.io. This is a great place to get started with angular as they have tutorials, fundamentals, techniques, ways to setup and deploy, etc.

* An interviewee might be asked what type of backend is most popularly used with the Angular framework, to test their competence on setting up an environment to complete an Angular application. They may also be asked about angular components, such as about the heroes component. . Lastly, the interviewee may be asked about Angular routing.
